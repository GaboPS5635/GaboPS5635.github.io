    <h2 id="history">History</h2>
    <p>Supreme was founded in 1994 in New York City by James Jebbia. The first store opened on Lafayette Street and was designed with skaters in mind — the center of the shop was left open so people could ride their boards inside.

    <p>Originally, Supreme catered to skaters, artists, and downtown youth, selling T-shirts, hoodies, and hats with bold, graphic designs. Its box logo, inspired by artist Barbara Kruger, quickly became iconic.</p>

    <p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Supreme gained a cult following. It began collaborating with other brands and artists, making limited-edition pieces that often sold out instantly. Supreme opened new locations in cities like Los Angeles, Tokyo, and London, expanding its global influence.</p>

A major moment came in 2017, when Supreme partnered with Louis Vuitton, blending high fashion with streetwear. In 2020, the brand was bought by VF Corporation for over $2 billion, but it continues to drop exclusive collections and shape youth fashion around the world.</p>

    <h2 id="brand">Brand Identity</h2>
    <p>Supreme is known for its bold red box logo with "Supreme" written in white Futura Heavy Oblique font. The logo is heavily inspired by Barbara Kruger’s work, which uses similar colors and typography. Supreme’s drop model (releasing limited items weekly) and collaborations with big-name artists and designers contribute to its status as a hype-driven streetwear brand.</p>
    <p>Supreme’s identity is built around exclusivity, simplicity, and street credibility. Its most recognizable feature is the red box logo with white text in a bold italic font. This design was inspired by artist Barbara Kruger, known for using bold text to critique consumer culture.</p>

    <p>Supreme releases new items through “drops” — small weekly releases that sell out in minutes. This strategy creates hype and scarcity, making the brand feel rare and valuable.</p>

    <p>The brand doesn’t advertise in traditional ways. Instead, it builds its image through word-of-mouth, limited availability, collaborations, and cultural influence. Supreme is seen as both a skate brand and a high-fashion icon — balancing underground cool with global fame.</p>

    <p>By keeping its products limited and its image carefully controlled, Supreme has become more than just a clothing brand — it’s a symbol of youth culture, rebellion, and exclusivity.</p>

    <h2 id="influence">Cultural Influence</h2>
    <p>Supreme is considered a pioneer in streetwear. The brand has heavily influenced fashion, music, and youth culture. Artists like Tyler, the Creator and Kanye West have worn Supreme, and its drops regularly cause lines around blocks at flagship stores.</p>
    <p>Even luxury brands have taken notice, as seen in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_(brand)#Louis_Vuitton" target="_blank">Supreme x Louis Vuitton</a> collaboration in 2017.</p>
    <p>Supreme also helped break the barrier between streetwear and high fashion. Its 2017 collaboration with Louis Vuitton showed that street culture had a place on global runways.</p>
    <p>Today, Supreme is more than just a brand — it represents a movement where art, skateboarding, fashion, and music all come together. Its success has inspired countless other brands to follow a similar model.</p>
